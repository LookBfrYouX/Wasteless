Feature: U16 Product images

#  So that products in the catalogue can be recognised easily, as a business administrator, I need to be able to associate images with them.
#  AC1: I can upload one or more images for the product. These will be displayed next to the product details.  If no image is supplied then a standard default image will be displayed.
#  AC2: If more than one image is uploaded then one of them is the primary image.  The default is for the first uploaded image to be the primary image.  I can change which image is the primary image. The primary image will be prominent next to the product details.
#  AC3: A thumbnail of the primary image is also created automatically. The thumbnail will be used in future stories.
#  AC4: I can delete product images. When the last image is deleted, a standard default image will be displayed.
