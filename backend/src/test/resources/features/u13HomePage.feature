Feature: U13 Home page

#  As a registered user (individual or business), I have a home page.
#  Note: A home page is separate to a profile page. While the profile page is visible to every logged-in user, the home page is only visible by me (or, if it is a business, by the administrators of that business). Depending on the stories your team has already implemented, the home page might currently be empty or may already contain items such as an inventory.   It is likely that future stories will introduce items such as a newsfeed.
#  AC1: When I log in, I am taken to my home page.
#  AC2: I can conveniently access my profile page from my home page.
