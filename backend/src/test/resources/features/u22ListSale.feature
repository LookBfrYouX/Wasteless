Feature: U22 List sale

  #  So that potential customers can purchase items from me, as a business administrator, I need to be able to list offerings for sale.

  Scenario: AC2 - Quantity must be above 0 and less than quantity of inventory entry - other listings of that item quantity

  Scenario: AC3 - Inventory entry used for calculating price of listing when quantity less than total

  Scenario: AC4 - Listing has optional field: moreInfo

  Scenario: AC5 - Closing uses inventory entry expiry date as default when not supplied
