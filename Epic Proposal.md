# Team 300 - Epic Proposal

## Epic Summary

## Value Added

### Introduction

The number of people on specific diets is on the rise. Whether the goal in mind is to lose weight or
to live a healthier life, it is clear that the number of diets is increasing. From 2017 to 2018,
there has been an increase of 22 percent of people on specific diets, from 14% to
36% ([and more recently 43](https://foodinsight.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2020-Food-and-Health-Survey-.pdf))
according to
[Food & Health Survey](https://foodinsight.org/one-third-of-americans-are-dieting-including-one-in-10-who-fast-while-consumers-also-hunger-for-organic-natural-and-sustainable/)
.

There is a clear need for a diet recognising sales platform that the Epic can provide. This will
ultimately **differentiate our application from our competitors and create an advantage**.
Specifically, as there is a gap in the market for a health focussed wholesaler and by focussing on a
more niche market segment. Additionally, the Epic can provide features that make product uploading
easier for Business Owners.

### Value added to Business Owners

By implementing an external API with information on products it decreases the amount of data that
the Business Owner needs to manually input into the application. By simply inserting the products
barcode an external API can return information such as:

- Product Title (e.g. "Marmite - Sanitarium - 250 g")
- Images of the product
    - Saves the Owner time by not needing to upload their own
- Nutritional, ingredient & diet information that can be displayed on the product listing page
    - Additionally, this can increase the likelihood of a sale as the products can cater to the
      users diet

### Value added to Users

As mentioned in the introduction, the amount of users with specific dietary requirements is
constantly increasing. This Epic would add value to the application by implementing features that
are more important for the user than ever before.

By implementing an external API with information on products we can use vitamin, mineral and
ingredient information to help filter down the search results to what the user would like to
purchase. This also includes filtering by diets like vegan, Paleo or Keto. Users can also avoid
specific ingredients such as nuts or certain preservatives. Value could also be added in future
stories such as implementing a calorie counter into the application.
