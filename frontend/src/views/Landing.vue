        <p>
          The number of people on specific diets is on the rise and while they are good for your
          health,
          experience will show they can be harmful to your wallet. The Navbara Pigeons have spent
          this
          year developing the solution to cater to the growing needs for nutritious food that
          doesnâ€™t
          break the bank.

          Nutrisave is a sales platform for near-expiring goods with a focus on providing the user
          with health-related information on the products. Users can view the nutritional and
          processed rating as well as the fat, sugar, and salt content of the food they buy. Users
          also have the ability to search products by their diet: No Gluten? No problem. Prefer
          veggies over meat? Easy!
        </p>
        <p>
          Nutrisave also makes the tedious task of adding products into the app an ease. Business
          owners
          can simply scan the barcode of the product or enter its number to autofill product and
          nutritional information.
